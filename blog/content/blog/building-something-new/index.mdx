Building something new isn't easy. When you create something new there's always the fear that the product you are working on may turn out to be a bust, and that you have therefore thrown months (or years) of work to the wind. This fear is justified and, certainly, any entrepreneur has had it and will continue to have it, but this fear is not a valid reason to give up, to abandon our projects and our vision of the world. We have to keep going and try to make our dreams come true. And that's what we're doing.

Zenith will soon become a company, with many smart people that will transform this little project to a great reality. But right now I'm the only one who's working on this platform, so let's briefly review what I've done so far.

<h3>AWS is gold</h3>

Among the many platforms available, and not having the opportunity to build an infrastructure dedicated entirely to Zenith, I decided to use **Amazon Web Services** as the cloud platform for my project. 
In addition, the configuration of the various AWS resources, such as EC2 instances, S3 buckets, Cloudfront CDNs and the managed relational databases, is pretty simple and logical — so I would recommend it to anyone looking for a cloud platform for their project. Moreover, for the first year and to a certain extent, you get to use some resources for free.

<h3>Design choices: icons, colors, and font</h3>

Speaking of the design, I'm trying to build a minimal web application (and this also applies to the mobile apps). I would like the design path of this project to follow that of the font used, namely <a href="https://rsms.me/inter/" target="_blank" title="The Inter typeface family" rel="noreferrer" aria-label="The Inter typeface family">Inter</a>, which presents a great coexistence of curved and broken lines.
For this reason, the icons — that I created using <a href="https://www.figma.com" target="_blank" title="Figma" rel="noreferrer" aria-label="Figma">Figma</a> — follow this style: you can see some of these icons on this website.

The main colors I've chosen are: `#141313`, `#3E3636`, `#386BD9` and `#D6CDCD`. I am confident that they're colors that contribute to give a serious and elegant look to the platform.

<h3>The mobile app</h3>

Alongside the web app, I'm also building the mobile application. I'm using React Native, so from one single codebase I'm able to create the Android and iOS versions of the app. I'm trying to create an app that is stable, visually beautiful and technically functional.

<h3>The backend</h3>

The backend is the part of the platform where I've been working the most. I'm currently working on the algorithms behind the recommendation of posts and content to the users. To make such things, I've been studying machine learning and data science.

<h3>Investments and accelerators</h3>

As for the issue of investment, I'm currently trying to find the best way to raise funds to further the development of Zenith. I'm thinking about taking part in some start-up accelerators, such as **Y Combinator** or **EuraTechnologies**. It would be great to be able to get funds to create the company, hire brilliant people, and buy better services to make Zenith a great product.

Having said that, have a good day and good luck with your projects. See you next time.
