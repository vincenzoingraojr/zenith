# Zenith | Brand

This repository contains resources for the Zenith brand such as logos, banners, icons, color palettes and other design files.
We use [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) to create, mantain and update the design files of Zenith (Figma is fantastic!).

## Icons

The icons used in Zenith were created specifically for the platform using **Figma**. You can see them [here](./icons/).

## Brand colors

We chose a few colors for the overall design of Zenith, because what we have in mind is to build a serious and minimal ecosystem.

Dark grey `#141313`

## Font used

Zenith uses [Inter](https://rsms.me/inter) as font. This font presents a coexistence of curved and broken lines and the [icons](./icons/) follow this style.

## Other things to know

To quote Zenith's name, capitalize the "Z" in Zenith in all copy text. Zenith shouldn't be presented in all lowercase.
