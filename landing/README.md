# Zenith | Landing page

This is the project landing page. It is a simple web page built with React.js and written in Typescript. We use this page to warn users that the entire platform is under construction.

## How to start the local front-end development

To start the development server properly, follow these instructions:

-   Run `yarn` to install all of the dependencies
-   Configure the [back-end](../server)
-   Create a `.env` file in the root of the `landing` folder
-   Copy the content of the existent `.env.example` file inside the `.env` file
-   Assign a value to the environment variables you find inside the `.env` file. It's usually done this way: `REACT_APP_SCHEMA_URL=http://localhost:4000/`
-   Run `yarn start`
